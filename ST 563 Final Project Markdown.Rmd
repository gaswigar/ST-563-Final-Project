```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(boot)
library(randomForest)
```

The file?

```{r fileread, include = TRUE}
ST563Wine <- read.delim("C:/Users/Jesse DeLaRosa/Desktop/Project/Grad School/ST 563 Statistical Learning/Final Project/winequality-red.csv", sep = ";")
```

THe splits?

```{r filesplit, include = TRUE}
ST563Wine <- ST563Wine %>% mutate("quality3cat" = factor(ifelse(quality > 0 & quality <=3, "Low",
                                                                     ifelse(quality > 3 & quality <= 7, "Mid", "High"))))

ST563Wine <- ST563Wine %>% mutate("quality2cat" = factor(ifelse(quality > 0 & quality <= 5, "Low", "High")))

ST563Wine %>% group_by(quality3cat) %>% summarise(count = n())
ST563Wine %>% group_by(quality2cat) %>% summarize(count = n())
unique(ST563Wine$quality)
```

I think it's worth noting that the range of possible scores for wine quality is 1-10, however the data only reflects scores of 3-8
